// declare/initialise , condition, change - these  are three things in any loop
// we have 2 types of loop - entry controlled and exit controlled
// Exit controlled loop is do while loop
// Entry controlled loop is for and while loop

// these three parameters are optional in loop...you have to give only ;; in a loop to be valid...but these are important if we want a correct loop that will give exactly what we want...

for(let i = 1; i<=5;i++){   
    console.log("Hello World");
    
}
